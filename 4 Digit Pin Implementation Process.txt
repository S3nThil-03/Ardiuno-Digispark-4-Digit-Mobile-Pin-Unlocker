1. Code Overview
Purpose: This Arduino sketch is designed for the Digispark ATtiny85 microcontroller. It attempts to unlock a mobile device's screen by brute-forcing the screen lock PIN using a predefined or iteratively generated passcode.
2. Hardware Requirements
Microcontroller: Digispark ATtiny85
Components:
Digispark board
Micro USB cable
(Optional) A mobile device for testing
3. Code Breakdown
Variables:
pass[]: Array to store passcodes (not currently used for brute-forcing).
pin[]: Example PIN array for entering a specific PIN.
pinIndex: Tracks the current digit of the PIN being entered.
pinEntered: A flag to indicate if the correct PIN has been entered.
count: Tracks the number of passcode attempts made.
Functions:
setup(): Initializes the program with a 3-second delay.
loop(): Main loop that attempts to enter the PIN and brute-force the screen lock if necessary.
enterPIN(): Placeholder function for entering a PIN.
isScreenLocked(): Placeholder function to check if the screen is locked.
4. How It Works
The program first waits for a 3-second delay.
It checks if the screen is locked using the isScreenLocked() function.
If the screen is locked, it starts brute-forcing the passcode from 0000 to 9999.
The code includes a delay of 3 seconds after each attempt and a 30-second delay after every 5 attempts to prevent the system from being locked out due to too many incorrect attempts.
5. Usage Instructions
Flash the code onto the Digispark ATtiny85.
Connect the Digispark to the mobile device (if needed).
The device will attempt to brute-force the PIN.
6. Important Notes
Security Considerations: This code should only be used for educational purposes or on devices you own and have permission to test. Unauthorized use of brute-forcing techniques on devices you do not own may be illegal.
Code Customization: The functions enterPIN() and isScreenLocked() are placeholders and should be customized according to your specific device and requirements.
7. Sample Output
The serial monitor will display each attempted passcode in sequence.

            count++;

            if (count == 5) {

                count = 0;
            }
        }
    }
}

void enterPIN() {
    // Implement your PIN entry logic here
}

bool isScreenLocked() {
    // Implement your logic to check if the screen is locked
    return false;
